## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Frontend to Netlify
Since you're already logged into Netlify, you can now:

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
4. Select the "BoomCard" repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Base directory: `partner-dashboard`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
   - Click "Deploy site"

### 2. Set up Supabase Database
1. Go to https://supabase.com and create a new project
2. Once created, go to Settings ‚Üí Database
3. Copy the connection string
4. Run the migration script in SQL Editor (located at `/database/supabase-migration.sql`)

### 3. Deploy Backend Services to Render
Each service has a `render.yaml` file configured. For the API Gateway:

1. Go to https://render.com/dashboard
2. Click "New" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select the BoomCard repository
5. Configure:
   - Name: boomcard-api-gateway
   - Root Directory: api-gateway
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
6. Add environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: (from Supabase)
   - `REDIS_URL`: (from Upstash - set up next)
   - `JWT_SECRET`: (generate a secure random string)

### 4. Set up Upstash Redis
1. Go to https://upstash.com
2. Create a new Redis database
3. Copy the Redis URL
4. Use this URL in your backend services

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
After all services are deployed, update:

1. **Netlify** (partner-dashboard):
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Your Render API Gateway URL
   - `REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URL`: Your Render Query Service URL
   - `REACT_APP_WS_URL`: WebSocket URL for Query Service

2. **Render** (backend services):
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Supabase connection string
   - `REDIS_URL`: Upstash Redis URL
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Secure random string
   - Service-specific URLs for inter-service communication

## üìù Important Notes

- The repository uses HTTPS, so you may need to provide GitHub credentials
- All services are configured to work with free tiers
- Backend services will auto-deploy when you push to GitHub
- Frontend will auto-deploy via Netlify's GitHub integration
- Database migrations must be run manually in Supabase
